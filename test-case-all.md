I'll help you brainstorm potential edge cases for both the frontend and backend of your real-time WebSocket notification system. Let me first understand the current implementation by looking at some key files.

Read file: backend/main.py

Read file: frontend/src/App.tsx
Based on the code I've reviewed, let me brainstorm potential edge cases for both frontend and backend:

**Frontend Edge Cases:**

1. **Connection Issues:**

   - What happens when the WebSocket connection drops unexpectedly?
   - How does the app handle network interruptions?
   - What if the user's internet connection is unstable?
   - How to handle reconnection attempts when the server is down?

2. **Authentication Edge Cases:**

   - What happens if the token expires while the WebSocket is connected?
   - How to handle token refresh during an active WebSocket connection?
   - What if the user logs out while notifications are still pending?

3. **UI/UX Edge Cases:**

   - How to handle multiple notifications arriving simultaneously?
   - What if the user receives a notification while in a different tab?
   - How to handle notifications when the browser is in background?
   - What if the user's device goes to sleep and wakes up?

4. **Browser/Device Edge Cases:**
   - How to handle different browser behaviors (Chrome vs Firefox vs Safari)?
   - What happens when the user switches between devices?
   - How to handle notifications when the browser tab is closed?
   - What if the user has multiple tabs open?

**Backend Edge Cases:**

1. **Connection Management:**

   - How to handle sudden server crashes?
   - What happens when the server needs to restart?
   - How to manage connection timeouts?
   - What if the server reaches its connection limit?

2. **Message Delivery:**

   - How to handle message queuing when a client is disconnected?
   - What happens if a message fails to deliver?
   - How to handle message ordering when multiple messages are sent?
   - What if a message is too large?

3. **Authentication & Security:**

   - How to handle invalid or expired tokens?
   - What if a user tries to connect with a fake token?
   - How to prevent connection flooding?
   - What if a user tries to impersonate another user?

4. **Scalability Issues:**

   - How to handle a sudden spike in connections?
   - What happens when the server memory is full?
   - How to manage connection cleanup for inactive users?
   - What if the database connection fails?

5. **Data Consistency:**

   - How to ensure notifications are not lost during server restarts?
   - What happens if a notification is sent to a non-existent user?
   - How to handle duplicate notifications?
   - What if the notification data is malformed?

6. **System Integration:**
   - How to handle database connection failures?
   - What happens if the Redis cache (if used) is down?
   - How to handle third-party service failures?
   - What if the load balancer fails?

Would you like me to dive deeper into any of these edge cases or explore additional scenarios? We can also discuss potential solutions for these edge cases if you're interested.
